# Food Delivery Time Prediction
By analyzing historical data and considering factors such as distance, traffic conditions, and order preparation time, the project seeks to provide reliable predictions for delivery times.\
The system utilizes a range of input variables such as the distance between the restaurant and the customer's location, current traffic conditions, order preparation time, and the ratings of the delivery personnel. These factors are fed into a machine learning model, which has been trained on a dataset of past delivery records, to generate predictions. \
